__For MyMNHS Developers__
You need to clone both the client and server code.
You can clone the client repository with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mnhs-shs/mymnhs_development.git
```

then clone the server with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mnhs-shs/mymnhs_server_dev.git
```

then change directory and install the dependencies for both of them with

```bash
npm i
```

Lastly, run both of them on different terminals with

```bash
npm run dev
```

### localhost:3000 for the client
### localhost:5000 for the server

However, if you are changing something that includes nodeMailer or tokens, the .env is not included so you need to message the [Head Developer](https://www.facebook.com/seno69000/)
