## Contributing

### For MyMNHS Developers

You need to clone both the client and server code.
You can clone the client repository with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mnhs-shs/mymnhs_development.git
```

then clone the server with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mnhs-shs/mymnhs_server_dev.git
```

```bash
npm i
```

Lastly, run both of them on different terminals with

```bash
npm run dev
```

- localhost:3000 for the client
- localhost:5000 for the server

However, if you are changing something that includes nodeMailer or tokens, the .env is not included so you need to message the [Head Developer](https://www.facebook.com/seno69000/)

### For Meycauayan Senior High School Students**

For MNHS students that want to contribute and
join the development team, we are also open so
just hit us up an email and we're looking forward to coding with you!
